# TPI_Bot

The following challenges have been set out for me to make a bot.
1) bot will get it's config from a config file at startup. (token, guildID, commadPrefix, etc)
2) bot should only be available to people with an ADMIN role
3) bot will take a userid, message and relay that message to the user
4) if the user replies, message everyone with an ADMIN role that reply

So... I don't really know how to work config files and such so Ill just do it my normal way.

This challenge is for a position im interviewing for.
